# Decision: Connector Credential Lifecycle (registration-linked, proactively-warned)

**Spec**: 007 — Connector Admin Counterpart (D9+D10) | **Status**: 🟢 SIGNED — codeable subset implemented (#34/#35/#36) | **Date**: 2026-06-12 | **Signed**: Ahmed Shaaban
**Supersedes**: the *reactive-only* credential model in [data-pulse-auth-and-api-policy.md §8](./data-pulse-auth-and-api-policy.md) (003)
**Closes**: [connector-token-scope.md](./connector-token-scope.md) — "awaiting DP2 delivery" (the awaited scope landed; see E-6 below)

## What changed

Spec 003 §8 recorded the connector's credential handling as **purely reactive**:

> `authenticated → token_revoked (401) → authenticated (operator re-provisions a fresh token)` …
> *"No automatic token rotation is in scope … token renewal requires explicit operator action."*

The credential was a bare, hand-edited `dp2_token` (a `Password` field in Connector Settings)
with **no link to a registration** and **no recorded lifecycle**. The only signal of a credential
problem was a 401 *after the fact*.

DP-2 has since **shipped** (018, PR #516) the operator-facing counterpart this connector was waiting
for: a `connector_registration` identity that survives credential rotation, a dedicated `connector`
bearer scope, a credential linked to the registration, and an admin surface to
register/issue/rotate/revoke/disable. The tightened `ConnectorAuthGuard` (US4) now **requires** a
presented token to be a `connector`-scoped credential linked to a non-disabled registration in its
own tenant — enforced at runtime, independently of the deferred DB consistency CHECK.

Spec 007 adopts that boundary on the connector side. The credential model is now
**registration-linked and proactively-warned**, not reactive-only.

## Evidence (the awaited delivery landed — closes connector-token-scope.md)

- **E-6.** `connector-token-scope.md` signed **Option A** (2026-06-04): *"DP2 provisions a new dedicated
  connector scope … MUST NOT reuse `dashboard_api`/`pos`/`pos_operator`,"* status "🟢 SIGNED — awaiting
  DP2 delivery," SC-001 blocked on DP-2 delivery. DP-2's `0021` migration now ships the `connector`
  scope + the admin issue/rotate/revoke surface (`connector-admin.yaml`, 018). **The awaited delivery
  has landed**; this is its connector-side adoption. The `connector-token-scope.md` dependency is
  therefore **CLOSED** (direction was already signed; the blocking delivery is now shipped).

## Decisions recorded

- **Lifecycle is registration-linked, not a bare token.** Connector Settings additively records the
  non-secret `dp2_connector_registration_id`, `dp2_credential_id`, `dp2_credential_issued_at`,
  `dp2_credential_expires_at`. `dp2_token` stays the only `Password` (secret) field — sourced from the
  once-shown `IssuedCredential.secret`, never hand-minted. *(007 §5; #34.)*
- **Proactive expiry warning replaces reactive-only.** The connector compares `now()` to
  `dp2_credential_expires_at` and emits an operator-facing `posting.credential.expiring` ops alert
  *before* a 401. The warning lead time is operator-configurable (`dp2_credential_warn_days`, default
  14). The connector **cannot self-rotate** — the 018 admin surface is human-session-only; it warns and
  prompts only. *(007 §6 / OQ-1; #35.)*
- **The 401 re-auth handling is preserved from 003 §8.** A 401 surfaces a non-disclosing
  re-authenticate state, never exposes the raw/previous token, and is never blind-retried as transient.
  This reactive path now **coexists** with the proactive expiry path (a credential revoked before its
  expiry surfaces as a 401 while the expiry model still reports "active"). *(007 T2.2; #34.)*
- **Local link-invariant is advisory (warn-only), OQ-2.** When a token is configured but no
  registration ref is recorded (a legacy unlinked credential), the connector emits a
  `posting.credential.unlinked` warning — it does **not** block. An unlinked legacy token still works
  until US4 enforcement is live, and the cutover legitimately sets the token before the registration
  ref; a hard block would risk a self-inflicted outage on a working credential. *(007 OQ-2; #36.)*
- **The 012 posting-feed runtime auth is unchanged.** Opaque revocable `connectorBearer`, scope
  `connector`, pull/ack — only *how the credential is provisioned/linked/rotated* changed (018), not
  the runtime auth scheme (028 §15 / OQ-10; mTLS is the documented upgrade path, not v1). *(007 G-4.)*

## Cutover

The legacy hand-edited token must be replaced with a registration-linked credential **before** US4
enforcement reaches the connector's environment, or it gets a breaking non-disclosing 401. The
operational sequence (register → issue-linked → reconfigure → verify → revoke-legacy) is the
[connector credential cutover runbook](../runbooks/connector-credential-cutover.md) (007 §7 / D10).

## Status of the spec-007 work

- **Implemented + merged (codeable subset):** the DocType lifecycle fields, the pure decision logic
  (expiry classification, configurable warning, 401 re-auth surfacing, rotation, link-invariant), and
  the poller wiring — #34 / #35 / #36, all locally unit-tested.
- **⏳ BENCH-VALIDATION (deferred, standing-rules §6):** `bench migrate` of the new fields and the
  poller's `frappe.logger` emit path run on a staging ERPNext v15 bench, not locally.
- **Operational (not connector code):** the cutover (T3 — human tenant-admin on the session-only admin
  surface + a live DP-2 round-trip) — see the runbook.
- **Open owner decision:** OQ-3 (where the human-operated admin-API client lives — Console per 028 §20,
  or a thin operator tool) — a cross-repo routing call, not a connector deliverable.
