# Runbook: Install the Connector on a Staging ERPNext Site

**Spec**: 001 — Frappe App Foundation | **Implements**: FR-009 | **Date**: 2026-06-04

Canonical staging install guide for `retail_tower_erpnext_connector`. **Staging only** —
production install is gated by [`upgrade-compatibility.md`](./upgrade-compatibility.md)
(constitution Principle III). This is the operational copy of the spec-local
`specs/001-frappe-app-foundation/quickstart.md`.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Frappe **bench** on the supported line: **Frappe v15 / ERPNext v15** (see
  [`../decisions/version-pin-upgrade-policy.md`](../decisions/version-pin-upgrade-policy.md)).
- A **staging** ERPNext site you can install apps onto (never production for this feature).
- Shell access to the bench directory.

> Version compatibility is **declared and documented, not enforced at install time**. A site
> outside the supported v15 line is unsupported; align versions before installing.

## Install steps

From the bench root:

```bash
# 1. Fetch the app into the bench
bench get-app retail_tower_erpnext_connector <repo-url>

# 2. Install onto the staging site
bench --site <staging-site> install-app retail_tower_erpnext_connector

# 3. Run migrations (no-op at the foundation; patches.txt has no patches)
bench --site <staging-site> migrate
```

## Verification

| Check | Command / action | Expected | Maps to |
|-------|------------------|----------|---------|
| App installed | `bench --site <staging-site> list-apps` | lists `retail_tower_erpnext_connector` | US1 / SC-001 |
| Site loads | open the ERPNext desk | loads without error | US1 |
| Metadata clear | inspect the app entry | name, description, publisher, license shown | US1 / FR-002 |
| Settings exist | search "Connector Settings" in the desk | opens the single config record | US2 / SC-002 |
| No business mutation | compare product/stock/sales counts | unchanged from before install | US1 / SC-003 / FR-005 |

## Run the foundation tests (on the bench)

```bash
bench --site <staging-site> run-tests --app retail_tower_erpnext_connector
```

These assert install + metadata, no business mutation, no ERPNext fork, and the Connector
Settings singleton (`tests/test_foundation.py`).

## Stock-posting prerequisites (RT-48)

POS sales post as Sales Invoices with `update_stock=1`: each submitted sale moves stock out of
the store's mapped warehouse, and a full void's return invoice moves it back. Owner decisions:
RT-47 (comment 10287) and RT-48 (comment 10291). Before the first POS sale, an ERP operator
sets the site up **in ERPNext Desk**. Retail Tower does not load stock or change these settings.

1. **Negative stock is allowed site-wide.** Set Stock Settings → *Allow Negative Stock* =
   `1` (`allow_negative_stock`). A POS sale must never be blocked because ERPNext on-hand is
   temporarily wrong. A negative Bin is an **operational stock discrepancy**: resolve it with
   the correct ERPNext stock operation (receipt, transfer, stock count). Never auto-correct it
   and never fabricate a receipt or adjustment.
   ```bash
   bench --site <site> execute frappe.db.set_single_value --args "['Stock Settings', 'allow_negative_stock', 1]"
   ```
2. **Perpetual-inventory accounts are configured** on the Company: default inventory, stock
   adjustment and cost-of-goods-sold accounts. A stock-moving sale also posts cost-of-goods GL
   entries.
3. **Every sellable mapped Item has a valuation source.** Use any of: an opening Stock
   Reconciliation with a valuation rate, Item `valuation_rate` or `standard_rate`, or a buying
   Item Price. Without one, ERPNext refuses the first stock-moving sale of that Item ("Valuation
   Rate for the Item … is required") even with negative stock allowed. The connector rejects that
   sale as `permanently_rejected / validation`. Once the Item master is fixed, recover it with the
   Backend-Core posting repair (`re_post`). The connector never posts a zero valuation.
4. **Opening stock** comes from an ERPNext **Stock Reconciliation** (purpose *Opening Stock*)
   per store warehouse, with quantity and valuation rate, dated **before** the first POS sale.
   It is strongly recommended for a correct baseline, but a missing balance does not block sales
   (see 1).
5. **Pilot Items are non-batch and non-serial** (`has_batch_no = 0`, `has_serial_no = 0`). The
   connector rejects a stock-moving invoice that contains a batch- or serial-tracked Item
   (`validation`), so one tracked line rejects the whole basket. Batch/expiry is a separate
   pharmacy capability (RT-50). This technical pilot is **not** pharmacy readiness.

6. **Confirm the exactly-once indexes exist (Gate G5) before go-live and after every upgrade.**
   Stock now moves inside the Sales Invoice submit, so a missing index duplicates **stock as well
   as revenue** when a crash-window re-offer happens.

   Why they could be missing (RT-54): Frappe's `install-app` marks every `patches.txt` entry
   completed **without running it**, and the indexes used to be created only by patches. Since
   RT-58 the connector ensures both indexes itself, idempotently and failing loudly:
   - the `after_install` and `after_migrate` hooks (`connector.schema`);
   - the Posting Log `on_doctype_update`.

   The posting poller also refuses to post while either index is missing. It logs
   `posting.guard.missing_index`, sales stay pending in Data-Pulse-2, and nothing is lost or
   duplicated. Still verify:
   ```sql
   SHOW INDEX FROM `tabSales Invoice` WHERE Key_name = 'unique_rt_si_provenance';  -- expect 2 rows
   SHOW INDEX FROM `tabPosting Log`   WHERE Key_name = 'unique_rt_posting_idem';   -- expect 2 rows
   ```
   If either returns no rows, run `bench --site <site> migrate`. `after_migrate` re-creates the
   indexes.

   If migrate then fails with `Gate G5: could not create …`, duplicate provenance rows already
   exist. Find them:
   ```sql
   SELECT rt_source_system, rt_external_id, COUNT(*) FROM `tabSales Invoice`
    WHERE rt_external_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1, 2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   SELECT source_system, external_id, COUNT(*) FROM `tabPosting Log`
    GROUP BY 1, 2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```
   Resolve each duplicate as follows. Never delete rows; every step leaves an audit trail.

   1. **Choose the surviving Sales Invoice.** This is the one the Posting Log row points to
      (`document_name`) and that Data-Pulse-2 recorded as `documentRef`. The others are extras.
      Deciding this is an **accounting and stock decision**.
   2. **Cancel each extra Sales Invoice in ERPNext Desk.** This reverses its stock and GL.
      Cancelling alone is **not enough**: a cancelled invoice keeps its provenance key, and the
      unique index covers cancelled rows too.
   3. **Re-tag the cancelled extra's provenance key** so it no longer conflicts, and leave an
      audit comment. The field holds at most 200 characters, so the replacement is a short
      bounded value derived from the row's own name, and the **original key is kept in the
      comment**. In `bench --site <site> console`:
      ```python
      name = "<extra SI name>"
      ext = frappe.db.get_value("Sales Invoice", name, "rt_external_id")
      assert frappe.db.get_value("Sales Invoice", name, "docstatus") == 2  # cancelled first
      frappe.db.set_value("Sales Invoice", name, "rt_external_id", f"g5-dup:{name}", update_modified=False)
      frappe.get_doc("Sales Invoice", name).add_comment("Comment", f"Gate G5 dedupe: rt_external_id re-tagged from {ext!r} (duplicate of the surviving invoice).")
      frappe.db.commit()
      ```
   4. **Posting Log duplicates.** Keep the row whose `document_name` is the surviving invoice.
      Re-tag each other row. **Fetch that row's own key first**, and never delete it:
      ```python
      row = "<Posting Log row name>"
      old = frappe.db.get_value("Posting Log", row, "external_id")
      frappe.db.set_value("Posting Log", row, "external_id", f"g5-dup:{row}", update_modified=False)
      frappe.get_doc("Posting Log", row).add_comment("Comment", f"Gate G5 dedupe: external_id re-tagged from {old!r}.")
      frappe.db.commit()
      ```
   5. **Re-run `bench --site <site> migrate`,** confirm both `SHOW INDEX` checks return 2 rows,
      and record the dedupe on the pilot issue. Posting resumes automatically on the next poller
      tick.

   If migrate reports `exists but is not UNIQUE on …`, an index with the right name has the
   wrong definition (for example after a manual repair). Drop it
   (`ALTER TABLE <table> DROP INDEX <name>`) and re-run `migrate`.

7. **The store's timezone equals the ERPNext site timezone (RT-49).** Invoices post on the sale's
   `businessDate` with `set_posting_time = 1`. Backend-Core derives `businessDate` in the
   **store** timezone, while ERPNext reads `posting_time` in the **site** timezone
   (System Settings → *Time Zone*). Both must be the same zone, for example `Africa/Cairo`.
   Owner decision: RT-49 comment 10312.
   - Check the site timezone:
     ```bash
     bench --site <site> execute frappe.utils.get_system_timezone
     ```
     Compare it with the store's timezone in Backend-Core. A store that has never been set up
     defaults to `UTC`.
   - How the connector sets the posting time:
     - **Sale:** the POS `occurredAt` time, converted to the site timezone and never later than
       now.
     - **Void or return (RT-16 / RT-63):** its **own** business date, at the time Backend-Core
       recorded it (`reversalOf.businessDate` / `recordedAt`, converted to the site timezone and
       never later than now). A late void posts on the day it happened and is **not** back-dated
       into its sale's day. It is still raised to the original invoice's timestamp if that is
       later, because ERPNext refuses a return dated before its original.
     - **Older Backend-Core** (no `recordedAt` / `businessDate` on the reversal): the connector
       falls back to the sale's date and time, so the void posts in its sale's fiscal day, as
       before.
     - **Closed accounting period:** if the reversal's own date falls in a closed or frozen period,
       ERPNext refuses it and the connector rejects it as `validation`. It never re-dates the
       posting. Repair is a finance decision (reopen the period or an approved adjustment),
       followed by a Backend-Core re-post.
   - When the zones disagree near midnight, or the POS clock runs ahead, the connector still keeps
     the posting date but clamps the time. It logs `posting.time_adjusted` at ERROR in
     `retail_tower_posting.log`. The listed adjustment tells you what to fix:
     - `clamped_to_business_day_start` or `clamped_to_business_day_end`: the store and site
       timezones disagree. Align them.
     - `capped_at_now`: the POS or host clock is ahead of the ERPNext server. Fix the time sync on
       the terminal. Do **not** change a timezone, because they may already match.
     - `raised_to_original`: expected only for invoices posted before RT-49.

8. **Map every tender method to a Mode of Payment that has a company account (RT-78).** A sale
   that carries tenders posts as one **Paid** Sales Invoice (`is_pos = 1`, one payment row per
   tender, no Payment Entry). RT-10 D3(b)/D5, amendment 011-DR-POSTING-A1.
   - In Connector Settings → *Tender → Mode of Payment Map*, add one row per method Backend-Core
     sends: `cash` and `card_external`. There is no default. A sale whose method has no row is
     rejected as `validation`, and nothing posts.
   - Each mapped Mode of Payment needs a **default account for the company** (Mode of Payment →
     *Accounts*). The card clearing account is finance configuration. A missing account makes
     ERPNext reject the invoice as `validation`.
   - The map may stay empty while every sale is tender-unknown. Those sales post unpaid, as
     before.
   - **Rollout order:** deploy this Connector version **before** Backend-Core starts accepting
     tenders (RT-77) or the POS starts sending them (RT-79). An older Connector would post a
     tendered sale unpaid, and that outcome is final.
   - A sale is rejected as `validation` when its tender total differs from its line total, or when
     ERPNext's computed totals leave change, a write-off or an outstanding amount. The invoice is
     rolled back, nothing is submitted, and it is a reconciliation case.
   - A void pays back the original invoice's own payment rows (same Modes of Payment and amounts).
     It is rejected if its tenders disagree with how the original was paid.

9. **Partial returns (RT-16).** A `return` posts a credit note with **only the returned lines**.
   Each row is linked to the original invoice row by the `Sales Invoice Item → RT Line Ref`
   custom field (RT-14 D6; installed by `migrate`), and the refund is paid out in cash through the
   tender map (prerequisite 8), even against a sale that posted unpaid. Decisions RT-14 10343 and
   RT-10 10394.
   - **Invoices posted before RT-16 carry no line ref.** A return against one is rejected as
     `validation`. Only invoices posted by this Connector version or later can take a partial
     return. A full void still works on older invoices.
   - A return is rejected as `validation` if:
     - it carries no refund tenders;
     - its refund total differs from the returned total;
     - a returned amount is not exactly unit price × quantity;
     - it returns more than the original line sold. ERPNext's over-return cap counts the earlier
       returns on the same line.
   - **Precision:** returned amounts must fit the currency precision (EGP has 2 decimals). ERPNext
     rejects a 4-decimal pro-rata amount (for example 10.00 ÷ 3), so that return is rejected as
     `validation`. Owner decision RT-87 (comment 10526) fixes this at the source instead of here:
     once Backend-Core runs RT-105 (merged to `main` at `7218fa9`), capture rejects a sale line
     whose money exceeds the currency's minor unit, whose line amount is not exactly unit price ×
     quantity, or whose quantity is fractional (422 `sale_line_pricing_invalid`). Every return of
     a line captured after that prices to exactly unit price × quantity and posts. A sale captured
     before it is never re-checked, so its partial return can still be rejected here; that return
     is a reconciliation case. The Connector itself is unchanged.
   - **Tax:** no tax rows are posted (VAT is 0 today). A return line with tax cannot settle and is
     rejected.
   - **Rollout order:** Backend-Core must keep `POS_RETURNS_ENABLED` **off** until this Connector
     version (RT-16 **and** RT-78) is deployed, **and** until Backend-Core puts each return's refund
     tenders on the posting feed.

Voids: a full void restores stock only if the original invoice moved it. Invoices posted before
RT-48 (`update_stock=0`) get an accounting-only credit note. A legacy amount-only refund is
rejected as `validation` (RT-71).

## Uninstall (safety check)

```bash
bench --site <staging-site> uninstall-app retail_tower_erpnext_connector
```

**Expected**: the app and its Connector Settings singleton are removed; ERPNext product,
stock, and sales data are **unchanged** (FR-010 / SC-003) — the app introduced no business
mutations to reverse.

## Validation result (local Docker Frappe v15 dev)

On **2026-06-04**, install / migrate / tests were validated on a local Docker Frappe dev
site (`retail.localhost`, Frappe 15.110.0, ERPNext 15.110.0, connector 0.1.0):

- `install-app` — **PASS**
- `migrate` — **PASS** (no-op)
- `run-tests` — **PASS** (8 tests, OK)
- `list-apps` — connector listed at 0.1.0

**Caveat**: this was local dev validation; Frappe warned MariaDB 11.8 is newer than its
tested range — not a production/staging DB recommendation. The full quickstart end-to-end
(including the uninstall safety check below) is **not yet run**. Full record:
[`specs/001-frappe-app-foundation/bench-validation.md`](../../specs/001-frappe-app-foundation/bench-validation.md).

## Out of scope (later specs)

Data-Pulse-2 authentication (003), product/price export (004), inventory export (005),
sales posting (006), tax/fiscal fields (007), and the full upgrade runbook (008) are not
part of this install. The foundation is structure + documentation only.
