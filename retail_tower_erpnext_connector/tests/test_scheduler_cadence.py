"""RT-45/RT-46 — pin the scheduler cadence of the Connector's pollers.

Owner decision (RT-45): a captured sale must reach ERPNext in <= ~1 minute via the existing
pull model, so the posting poller runs every minute (Frappe's finest cron granularity). The
019 bin-view poller is NOT part of that decision and stays on */5. ``hooks.py`` is plain data
(re-applied on every ``bench migrate``), so this is a pure unit test — no frappe, no bench.
