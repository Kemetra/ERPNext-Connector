"""Frappe-free checks that the shipped Custom Field fixtures are complete and exported (RT-16).

``fixtures/custom_field.json`` is only synced for the names the ``hooks.fixtures`` filter lists; a
field added to the JSON but missing from the filter silently never reaches a site (and the
connector would then write a field ERPNext drops). RT-16 / RT-14 D6 adds the Sales Invoice Item
``rt_line_ref`` custom field (authorized in decision 10343) that return rows are matched on.
