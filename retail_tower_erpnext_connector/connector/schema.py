"""Gate G5 schema invariants — ensured on install AND every migrate (RT-58). ⏳ BENCH-VALIDATION.

Root cause (RT-54): Frappe's ``install_app`` marks every ``patches.txt`` entry completed WITHOUT
running it (``frappe.installer.set_all_patches_as_completed``). The two exactly-once indexes were
created only inside patches, so every FRESH install silently lacked them. The patches stay for the
upgrade path; this module makes the invariant hold everywhere:

  - ``after_install`` / ``after_migrate`` hooks (``hooks.py``) call :func:`ensure_g5_indexes`;
  - the Posting Log controller's ``on_doctype_update`` also ensures its own index on DocType sync
    (ERPNext's pattern: ``erpnext/stock/doctype/bin/bin.py`` ``on_doctype_update`` → ``add_unique``).

Both ensure steps are idempotent. If an index cannot be created — e.g. duplicate provenance rows
already exist — they FAIL LOUD (the migrate errors) instead of recording silent success; the
poller's runtime guard (``posting.index_guard``) keeps posting paused until it is fixed.
