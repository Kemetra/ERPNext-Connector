"""Which reversal work-items the connector may post (RT-71; RT-14 F1, owner decision D8).

An amount-only refund cannot be posted correctly. Backend-Core never projects the refund amount
into the posting feed, so a ``reversalKind=refund`` work-item carries EVERY sale line at full
value, and the reversal builder would negate them all: any refund, even a partial one, became a
credit note for the whole sale (RT-48 bench: ACC-SINV-2026-00028 = -24.00 against a 24.00 sale).

Until line-aware returns land (RT-14 contract → RT-72/RT-73 in Backend-Core → RT-16 here), a refund
is rejected as ``permanently_rejected / validation``. Nothing is posted, so no stock or GL moves.
Once returns are supported, a rejected refund can be recovered with the Backend-Core ``re_post``
repair. A full void is unaffected. This module imports NO frappe.
