"""Tender → ERPNext Mode of Payment resolution (RT-78, RT-10 D5).

The operator maps each posting-feed tender method to an ERPNext Mode of Payment in Connector
Settings (config, injected — never hardcoded). An unmapped method fails closed
(:class:`UnmappedTender`) → ``permanently_rejected`` / ``validation``: there is no default Mode of
Payment and the connector never guesses one or its account (Principle VI).

Settlement (RT-10 D3(b), amendment 011-DR-POSTING-A1): a tender-bearing sale posts as ONE Sales
Invoice carrying its own payments — one row per tender, amount verbatim. :func:`build_payments`
builds those rows. It fails closed when the tender total differs from the invoice total the
connector builds from the lines (amendment §4a: never adjust a line, invent change or leave a
partial balance to force a match) and never derives a tender from ``posTotal`` (R1).

This module imports NO frappe.
