"""Posting page processor — the re-P2b hybrid isolate + raise-after loop (Task A).

Per the ratified re-P2b decision: a feed page line missing ``erpnextItemRef`` is an upstream
DP2 contract violation (rider R2). The connector:

  - treats it as a **terminal validation rejection for that work item only**
    (`permanently_rejected` / `validation` — the wire category is the closed-set `validation`;
    the specificity rides in the reason ``message``);
  - **never** resolves, searches, creates, or substitutes an ERPNext Item;
  - **continues** processing the valid work items on the same page;
  - records every per-item outcome FIRST, then **raises a page-degraded alert AFTER** so the DP2
    feed contract can be fixed — never an abort that strands valid or already-acked items;
  - relies on the per-outcome ack key + the idempotency store to make a scheduler retry safe.

This module imports NO frappe — it is pure orchestration over the injected client + poster.
