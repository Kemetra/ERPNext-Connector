"""Partial-return work-item → return Sales Invoice (credit note) builder (RT-16).

A 012 ``reversalKind: return`` (RT-14 D1) carries only the returned lines (``returnLines``, priced by
Backend-Core by the cumulative-difference rule) and how the cash was paid out (``refundTenders``,
RT-14 D3, cash only). It posts a return Sales Invoice that:

  - carries ONLY the returned lines, negated (qty and amount; the rate stays positive), each tagged
	with its ``rt_line_ref`` so the glue links it to the ORIGINAL invoice row by identity (RT-14 D6
	custom field) and takes that row's warehouse;
  - pays the refund out from ``refundTenders`` through the CURRENT tender map (RT-10 D6): it is a new
	cash payout, not a mirror of the sale's tenders, so it applies even to a tender-unknown sale;
  - is unrounded (RT-80) and stock-moving (the glue mirrors the original's ``update_stock``);
  - posts on the return's own business date at its recorded time (RT-63, :func:`reversal_stamp_source`).

It COMPOSES on :func:`builder.build_sales_invoice` — the returned lines become the lines of a
synthetic sale snapshot and the refund tenders its tenders — so money validation (FR-009), the
tender == line total check (amendment 4a) and the payments rows come from the single forward money
path. The result is then negated. Pure: no frappe, no ERPNext call.

Fail closed (all ``validation``): a return with no ``refundTenders`` (the feed INVARIANT says every
return carries them — an outstanding credit note would hide cash that left the drawer), a refund
total that differs from the returned total, an unmapped refund method, and a returned line whose
``lineAmount`` is not exactly ``unitPrice x quantity`` (ERPNext recomputes ``amount = rate x qty``,
so it would post a different amount than Backend-Core recorded).

Tax: like the forward builder, no tax rows are posted (Egyptian VAT is 0 today), so a return line
with a non-zero ``taxAmount`` is rejected outright (:class:`ReturnTaxNotPosted`) — never posted with
its tax silently dropped, whatever the refund covers (Codex P2, PR #50).
