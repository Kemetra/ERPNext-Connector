"""Pure stock-posting policy for stock-moving Sales Invoices (RT-48).

Owner decisions (RT-47 comment 10287; RT-48 comment 10291):

  - **D4 — no guessed batches.** The technical pilot moves stock only for non-batch / non-serial
    Items. ERPNext would otherwise AUTO-PICK a batch/serial on an outward line
    (``auto_create_serial_and_batch_bundle_for_outward`` defaults on) — a guess — so a tracked
    Item on a stock-moving document fails CLOSED (:class:`UnsupportedTrackedItem` → ``validation``).
    Batch/expiry is a separate pharmacy capability (RT-50).
  - **D5 — a full void restores stock exactly once, and only if the sale moved it.** The return
    invoice MIRRORS the original invoice's ``update_stock`` (a legacy ``update_stock=0`` invoice
    gets an accounting-only credit note — never a fabricated stock restoration; ERPNext also refuses
    ``update_stock=1`` against a non-stock original) and references each original line via
    ``sales_invoice_item`` so ERPNext's per-line over-return cap (``StockOverReturnError``) applies.
  - **RT-80 — a full void reverses the original's rounding too.** The return also MIRRORS the
    original's ``disable_rounded_total``. A sale posted before RT-80 was rounded (10.49 -> AR 10.00
    + Round Off 0.49); an unrounded -10.49 void of it would leave a -0.49 customer credit and never
    reverse the Round Off. Mirroring makes the void net to exactly zero in both cases.
  - **RT-78 / RT-10 D6 — a full void pays back exactly what the original was paid with.** The
    void's payments are rebuilt from the ORIGINAL invoice's own payment rows (Mode of Payment and
    amount as booked), so a tender map remapped since the sale cannot refund through a different
    mode. The void's ``sale.tenders`` (already negated onto ``doc`` by the reversal builder) only
    cross-check it: a paid void of an unpaid original, an unpaid void of a paid original, or a
    different total fails closed (:class:`VoidSettlementMismatch`).

  - **RT-16 / RT-14 D6 — a partial return links by line identity.** Each return row is matched to
    the original row carrying the same ``rt_line_ref`` (never by position), restores to that row's
    warehouse and mirrors ``update_stock``; an original posted before RT-16 has no line refs and
    fails closed (:func:`link_return_to_original`).

The frappe glue only READS the Item flags / original invoice rows and calls these functions.
This module imports NO frappe and never mutates its inputs.
