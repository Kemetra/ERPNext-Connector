"""Idempotency replay logic for posting (T040/T042).

A FORWARD ``sale_post`` is keyed on the 012 O-3 wire anchor ``(sourceSystem, externalId)``
(FR-005): the same logical sale maps to the same ERPNext document, and a re-offer echoes the
existing ``documentRef`` unchanged (Principle IV / Gate G5). The connector introduces NO new
idempotency primitive beyond the 012 contract.

REVERSAL re-key (Connector #28): DP2 emits the ORIGINAL sale's ``externalId`` as the top-level
anchor on a ``kind=reversal`` work-item (per-reversal distinctness lives only in
``source_ref_id``, which is NOT on the wire). Keying a reversal on ``externalId`` would collide
with the original sale's replay slot — the guard would echo the original sale's invoice and ack
``posted`` with no credit note (silent mis-success). The connector-side per-reversal-distinct
value that IS on the wire is ``work_item_ref`` (the 012 ``PostingWorkItem.workItemRef`` status-row
id, required, already the ack identity). So a reversal is keyed on ``(sourceSystem, workItemRef)``.

ONE DISCRIMINATOR, THREE CONSUMERS: :func:`provenance_id` is the single source of truth for the
per-posting-distinct provenance value. It is the second element of the replay key (here), the
``rt_external_id`` the builder writes (``reversal_builder``), and the value
``frappe_glue._find_posted_invoice`` looks up by. All three MUST read it so the crash-recovery
path cannot drift back into the #28 bug.

The persistence is abstracted behind :class:`IdempotencyStore` (a Protocol — the repo's
Repository pattern). The concrete Frappe-DocType-backed store is the deferred ``[GATED]``
T020 adapter (its DocType JSON is a forbidden surface, standing-rules §3) and a
⏳ BENCH-VALIDATION concern. This module imports NO frappe.
