"""Pure Connector Settings parsers (frappe-free).

The poller's ``_load_*`` stubs read Connector Settings child tables (a frappe-coupled, bench-only
act via ``frappe.get_doc``) and then transform the raw DocType rows into the dict shapes
:class:`uom.UomMap` / :class:`uom.PreResolvedWarehouse` / :class:`uom.StoreCustomerMap` consume.

That TRANSFORM is split out here as pure functions so the branching logic (empty rows, blank
values, duplicate keys) is unit-testable WITHOUT frappe — leaving only a three-line frappe read in
the poller shell. Each row is a plain mapping (a Frappe child-table row exposes ``.get(field)`` and
is dict-like) or a Document with field attributes; we read by field name either way.

Fail-loud philosophy (Principle VI): a half-filled or duplicate config row is a CONFIG error
surfaced at load time, never a silent skip — a silently-dropped mapping would later masquerade as a
data problem (an "unmapped unit/store" rejection on a sale that was actually mis-configured).

This module imports NO frappe.

    Every posting work-item carries a store and ≥1 line (012 ``minItems: 1``), and the builder
    resolves all three maps unconditionally — so an EMPTY map guarantees 100% rejection, which is
    indistinguishable from "not yet configured". If the operator saved credentials before finishing
    the maps, activating the poll would PERMANENTLY reject every pending sale (terminal
    ``permanently_rejected``/``validation`` → DP2 DLQ, recoverable only via 017) — a Principle VI
    inversion (a config gap masquerading as a data rejection).

    So a fully-empty required map is treated as "not configured": this raises, the poller's
    ``_build_posting_path`` lets it propagate, and ``run_posting_poll`` logs ``posting.poll.skipped``
    and skips the tick — sales stay ``pending`` until the connector is fully configured.

    IMPORTANT — this gates ONLY the EMPTY (unconfigured) state. A NON-empty map with a specific key
    absent (store B unmapped while A is live) is a GENUINE terminal rejection (decision-table rows
    5/8) and is left to the per-item ``UnmappedUnit``/``UnmappedStore`` path in ``frappe_glue``,
    UNCHANGED — this helper never inspects individual keys.
