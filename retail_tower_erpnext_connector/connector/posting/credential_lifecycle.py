"""Pure credential-lifecycle helpers (spec 007 — Connector Admin Counterpart, D9 / G-2).

Today the connector is purely *reactive* about its DP2 credential (E-5): the only signal of a
credential problem is a 401 on a live pull/ack. Spec 007 records the credential's bounded
``expires_at`` in Connector Settings (§5) so the connector can be *proactive* — compare ``now()``
to the expiry and surface an operator-facing 'credential expiring — request rotation' state BEFORE
a 401 ever fires (§6, Goal G-2).

The connector CANNOT self-rotate: the 018 admin surface that mints credentials is human-session-only
(N-5). These helpers only *evaluate* lifecycle state and *apply* a rotation the operator/admin
performed out-of-band; they never call DP2 and never mint a credential.

Design — time is INJECTED, not read from a hidden clock:
  - ``evaluate_expiry`` takes ``now`` and ``expires_at`` as explicit ``datetime`` params, so the
    warning-window boundary is deterministically testable (the ``posting/transport.py`` injected-fake
    pattern). The bench-only poller shell passes ``frappe.utils.now_datetime()``.

Secret discipline (S-1 / Gate G4): these helpers are NEVER given the raw token. They operate on the
NON-secret lifecycle fields only (registration id, credential id, expiry) — so no operator-facing
message can leak a secret.

This module imports NO frappe.
