"""Reversal work-item → reversing-document (return Sales Invoice) builder (Arc A S1).

A 012 ``kind=reversal`` work-item posts a **negative-qty return Sales Invoice** — in ERPNext a
credit note IS a Sales Invoice with ``is_return=1`` (CHECKPOINT-1 decision, chosen for symmetric
DP-017 reconciliation against the 1:1 forward SI). This is a pure dict-transform: no frappe, no
ERPNext call — the bench glue submits the dict.

It COMPOSES on :func:`builder.build_sales_invoice`: that builder validates money on the positive
magnitudes once (FR-009; ``uom.assert_money_conformance`` runs there), so there is a single money
path and no duplicated line loop. This builder then:

  - sets ``is_return = 1`` (credit-note discriminator);
  - **negates** each line's ``qty`` and ``amount`` (return semantics); leaves ``rate`` positive
    (ERPNext convention — the sign lives on qty);
  - writes the provenance fields from the #28 discriminator: ``rt_external_id`` =
    ``idempotency.provenance_id(work_item)`` (= ``work_item.work_item_ref`` for a reversal),
    ``rt_source_system`` = ``work_item.source_system`` (THE F-002 RULE — see below);
  - posts ON the reversal's own business day AT its server event time (RT-16 / RT-63, decision
    10348): ``reversalOf.businessDate`` + ``reversalOf.recordedAt`` with ``set_posting_time = 1``, so
    a late void is NOT back-dated into the sale's day (:func:`reversal_stamp_source`). An older
    Backend-Core that sends neither falls back to the RT-49 rule (the sale's ``occurredAt`` on the
    work item's ``businessDate``). The glue then raises the stamp to the original invoice's posting
    timestamp if that is later (``posting_time.raise_to_original``).

THE CRITICAL CORRECTNESS CONSTRAINT (F-002 + Connector #28): the ``unique_rt_si_provenance`` index
spans ALL Sales Invoices via ``rt_external_id``. DP2 emits the ORIGINAL sale's ``externalId`` as the
top-level anchor on a reversal work-item (``work_item.external_id == reversal_of.external_id ==
sale.external_id`` — the original sale's id, NOT per-reversal-distinct). Writing that into
``rt_external_id`` would collide with the original SI's unique key and be FALSELY treated as a
dup-recovery — silently echoing the original invoice with no credit note (#28). The
per-reversal-distinct value that IS on the wire is ``work_item_ref`` (the ack identity), so the
reversing doc carries ``idempotency.provenance_id(work_item)`` (= ``work_item_ref``). This is the
SAME value the replay key uses (``idempotency.key_for``) and the value
``frappe_glue._find_posted_invoice`` queries by — one discriminator, three consumers.

Cardinality: forward sale→SI is 1:1; reversal→original is **N:1** (successive partial returns).
Each reversal work-item has its OWN ``work_item_ref`` / reversal key, so each yields a distinct
``rt_external_id`` even when several share one ``external_id`` (the original sale). Idempotency is
per reversal-request key, reusing the same ``store`` replay primitive the sale_post path uses (in
the glue leg).

``return_against`` is NOT resolved here: mapping ``reversal_of`` → the original SI's ERPNext docname
needs a DB hit, and this builder's injected signature carries no SI-resolver. The pure builder emits
a standalone ``is_return=1`` credit note (ERPNext accepts that without ``return_against``); the
bench-pending ``frappe_glue`` reversal leg resolves the original SI by
``(reversal_of.source_system, reversal_of.external_id)`` and sets ``return_against`` before insert.
