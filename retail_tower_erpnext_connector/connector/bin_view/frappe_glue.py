"""Frappe glue for the bin-view worker — BENCH-VALIDATION.

The frappe-touching seam: reads the live ERPNext ``Bin`` rows for a warehouse and
supplies the connector ``readAt`` clock. Imports ``frappe`` (and reads the ``Bin``
doctype), so it is validated on a bench, not locally (standing-rules §6). The pure
quantize/report logic it feeds lives in :mod:`.worker` (unit-tested locally).

Validated ``Bin`` shape (real staging doctype): ``item_code`` (Link Item),
``warehouse`` (Link Warehouse), ``actual_qty`` (Float), ``stock_uom`` (Link UOM).
Reads QUANTITY only — NO valuation/cost field (019 / Principle IX).

RT-176 paged read (stock-view 1.2) — CONSISTENCY ASSUMPTION (not bench-verified): the
keyset pages of one :meth:`FrappeBinReader.read_bins_paged` call are issued back-to-back
inside the scheduler job's single DB transaction (Frappe opens one per job; nothing in the
bin-view tick commits — the cursor/retry state lives in the Redis cache). On MariaDB/InnoDB
under REPEATABLE READ (the InnoDB default) every page therefore reads the same consistent
snapshot. If the session runs READ COMMITTED (or on Postgres), each page sees its own
snapshot: keyset paging over the unique per-warehouse ``item_code`` still never repeats or
skips an item that exists throughout the read, but a quantity moved between two pages may
reflect a slightly later instant. Bench evidence for this is a recorded follow-up.
