"""Bounded retry set for bin-view requests whose report did not reach completion (RT-176).

DP2's bin-view feed is a keyset on the run, and the poller saves the feed cursor past every
page it has handled. Before RT-176 a request whose report failed (a transport error, a
mid-attempt failure) was therefore never offered again and its 017 run stayed ``running``
(the stranded-run defect at ``poller.py`` ~71). The poller now keeps such requests here —
persisted BEFORE the cursor moves — and re-reads + re-reports them on later ticks. A retry
of a connector-paged request is always a FRESH read attempt (new ``attemptRef`` from window
0), which DP2 treats as a supersede of the incomplete attempt.

The set is bounded twice: an entry is abandoned after :data:`MAX_RETRY_TICKS` failed retries
(the poller logs ``bin_view.report.incomplete_abandoned``), and at most
:data:`MAX_PENDING` requests are held at once (a failure that does not fit is abandoned at
once, with the same log).

The poller bounds the inline (v1) work of one tick — new feed requests and retries combined —
by ``poller.MAX_INLINE_ATTEMPTS_PER_TICK`` and a tick time budget (Codex P1s on #56), so a run
of slow transports cannot push the cron job past its queue timeout before the state is saved;
paged requests are handed off to a long-queue job instead (see ``poller``). A
retry is CHARGED before it runs (:meth:`RetrySet.charge_retry`) and the poller checkpoints the
set before and after every attempt, so an attempt cut short by a killed worker still counts
toward the abandon bound. Charging moves the request to the back of the order, so requests
not reached this tick go first next tick (FIFO rotation — no starvation).

Pure Python (NO frappe); the poller persists :meth:`RetrySet.to_state` in the frappe cache.
The state stores each request in its pulled WIRE shape, so a stored entry survives a
connector upgrade; an entry that no longer parses is dropped.
