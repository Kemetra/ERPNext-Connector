"""Bin-view poller — the scheduled entrypoint — BENCH-VALIDATION.

Registered as a ``scheduler_events`` cron in ``hooks.py`` (Frappe v15 runs it on the DEFAULT
queue, 300 s job timeout). On each tick it:

  1. builds the 019 client over the spec-003 auth (reuses Connector Settings
     ``dp2_base_url`` + ``dp2_token``) + the frappe-backed Bin reader + a UTC clock;
  2. folds in the outcomes that finished paged-report jobs left behind (see below);
  3. drains the bounded retry set (RT-176, :mod:`.retry`), oldest first: a v1 request is
     re-attempted inline (charged and checkpointed before it runs, checkpointed again after);
     a paged request is handed off to a long-queue job (cheap — no network);
  4. pulls wanted Bin-view reads (``binViewPullRequests``) page by page; a new v1 request is
     charged into the retry set, checkpointed, then read and reported inline (one report, v1
     key); a paged request (``maxWindows > 1``) is handed off. The cursor advances request by
     request (to its ``itemCursor``) and only past a request whose outcome is durable.

INLINE WORK IS BOUNDED (Codex P1s on #56). All inline v1 attempts of a tick — retries and new
feed requests COMBINED — share :data:`MAX_INLINE_ATTEMPTS_PER_TICK` (5 x 30 s transport
timeout), and no DP2 call (pull or attempt) starts once ``elapsed + 30 s`` would pass
:data:`_TICK_BUDGET_S` (240 s), so the tick stays under Frappe v15's 300 s default-queue
timeout. When the budget runs out mid-page, the rest of the page is left for the next tick: the
cursor stays before the first unprocessed request, so nothing is skipped or processed twice.

PAGED REPORTS RUN OFF THE CRON QUEUE (Codex P1s on #56). One paged attempt makes one DP2 call
per window (up to ``maxWindows``, 30 s transport timeout each), which can outlast the cron's
300 s default-queue timeout; a killed worker would restart the attempt at window 0 forever.
So the tick hands each paged request to :func:`run_paged_report_job` via
``frappe.enqueue(queue="long", timeout=<budget + margin>, job_id="rt_bin_view_paged::<ref>",
deduplicate=True)``: one job per request at a time, with an explicit timeout derived from
``worker.attempt_budget_s(maxWindows)`` (``maxWindows x 30 s + 60 s``, capped at 1200 s) plus
:data:`_JOB_TIMEOUT_MARGIN_S`, so always under the long queue's 1500 s. Inside the job an
:class:`~.worker.AttemptDeadline` (same budget) ends the attempt cleanly BEFORE any window call
that could overrun it — no ``isFinal`` is sent and the job is never killed mid-write. The
handed-off request is charged in the retry set BEFORE the enqueue; the job writes its outcome
to ``rt_bin_view_outcome::<ref>`` and the next tick folds it in (resolve, or settle the
failure). The retry set therefore has ONE writer — the cron tick, which Frappe never runs
twice at once — and a job that dies without an outcome simply counts as a failed attempt.
An attempt is never resumed across jobs/ticks: stock-view 1.2 defines no attempt lifetime or
continuation, only that window 0 under a new ``attemptRef`` supersedes, so every retry is a
fresh attempt.

A request whose report did not reach completion for a RETRYABLE reason (a transport error,
an unexpected DP2 status, a mid-attempt failure, a superseded attempt, an explicit
``complete: false``, the attempt deadline) stays in the retry set, which is saved BEFORE the
cursor advances past its page — so a failed run is never stranded behind the saved cursor (the
pre-RT-176 defect). After ``retry.MAX_RETRY_TICKS`` failed retries it is abandoned with
``bin_view.report.incomplete_abandoned``. Deterministic refusals are terminal and logged, not
retried: the v1 overflow, the paged ``bin_view.window.limit_exceeded``, a 409 idempotency-key
conflict, and a 404 stale run.

This is the composition root; it imports ``frappe`` and the glue, so it is validated on
a bench, not locally (standing-rules §6). The pure pull/report/quantize/retry logic lives in
``transport.py`` + ``worker.py`` + ``retry.py`` (unit-tested locally); this is the thin frappe
shell (its tick and job logic is also exercised locally against a frappe stand-in).
