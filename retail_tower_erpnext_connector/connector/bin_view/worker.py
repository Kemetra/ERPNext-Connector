"""Bin-view worker — pure read-and-report logic for one pulled request.

For each :class:`~.transport.BinViewRequest`, the worker reads the live ERPNext ``Bin``
on-hand per Item for the request's warehouse (via an injected :class:`BinReader` — the
frappe-touching part is the bench glue), builds an exact-decimal
:class:`~.contracts.BinViewSnapshotReport`, and reports it back to DP2 with a
deterministic ``Idempotency-Key``.

Two paths, chosen by the pulled request (stock-view 1.2, RT-176):

* v1 — ``itemWindow.maxWindows`` absent or 1: one report with no ``window`` object, key
  ``binview-{requestRef}``, and a loud refusal (:class:`WindowOverflowError`) above
  ``maxItems`` items. Unchanged from 019 v1.
* paged — ``maxWindows > 1``: ONE read attempt (keyset pages, see
  :meth:`BinReader.read_bins_paged`) split into windows 0..N of at most ``maxItems``
  entries, all sharing one fresh ``attemptRef`` and one ``readAt``; reported in order
  with ``isFinal`` on window N only, each keyed
  ``binview-{requestRef}-{attemptRef}-w{seq}``. Above ``maxWindows x maxItems`` items
  :class:`WindowLimitExceeded` is raised and NOTHING is reported. A failure mid-attempt
  propagates; the poller retries later with a FRESH attempt from window 0 (DP2
  supersedes the incomplete one). An optional :class:`AttemptDeadline` ends the attempt
  cleanly BEFORE a window call that could overrun the attempt's time budget
  (:class:`AttemptDeadlineExceeded`, no ``isFinal`` sent), so the worker running it is
  never killed mid-write.

§III: ERPNext ``Bin.actual_qty`` is a FLOAT; the connector converts it to an
exact-decimal STRING deterministically (round HALF-EVEN to 6 fractional digits — the
019 contract precision cap) so DP2 never receives a float. NO valuation is read.

This module imports NO frappe — the Bin read is behind :class:`BinReader`; tested
locally against a fake. The live composition root is :mod:`.poller` (bench-validated).
