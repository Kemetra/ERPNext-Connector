"""Posting Log DocType controller (connector spec 006, Task B).

One row per posted Data-Pulse-2 sale, keyed on ``(source_system, external_id)`` — the 012 O-3
wire idempotency anchor. The composite UNIQUE index on that pair (added by the
``posting_log_unique_idem`` migration patch) is the database-level guarantee that makes posting
exactly-once (Gate G5): a concurrent or replayed insert for the same pair fails at the DB, so the
connector resolves to the already-recorded ``document_name`` instead of creating a second ERPNext
document — closing the crash-between-submit-and-record window that the in-memory store could not.
