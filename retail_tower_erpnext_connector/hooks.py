#   - scheduler_events: the posting poller (pull -> post -> ack).
# No doc_events / override_doctype_class are registered (the connector posts via
# its own scheduled worker; it does not intercept ERPNext document events).
# See the constitution (Principle VII) and specs/006-sales-posting-adapter/.

# The posting poller — pulls posting work-items from Data-Pulse-2, posts each to ERPNext,

# <= ~1 minute; each run drains the whole pending backlog, and Frappe never overlaps two runs.
